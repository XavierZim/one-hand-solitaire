# one-hand-solitaire
A python program written out of frustration of not being able to win at this simple yet annoyingly impossible game

<h1>The Rules</h1>

The rules are simple. Make sure you have at least four cards at all time in your hand. If the top card and the card in the fourth place are the same suit, you can take out the cards in between them (i.e. the cards in the second and third positions). If instead the cards are the same rank, then you remove all the top four cards in your hand. If you dont have any matches, keep drawing cards. keep drawing until you run out of cards to draw. You win by ending with 0 cards left over in your hand.
